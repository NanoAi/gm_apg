Due to seemingly consistent issues with the code base of APG I've made PUG.
However I doubt PUG will get any updates because I simply no longer play Garry's mod,
but if you'd like to check my alternative to APG, check out [__PUG__ on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/NanoAi/gm_pug) or [__PUG__ Github Mirror](https://github.com/NanoAi/gm_pug)

------------------

This will no longer be updated as I can no longer support it, if you are looking for a good alternative please check out PUG linked above. It's also free, and can do almost everything APG can do.

Also please for the love of god, don't pay for stuff like this.

# APG - Anti Prop Griefing & Crash Protection

![- APG - Light Weight, Easy to Use, Stops Crashes](https://i.imgur.com/DrbZOgk.png "APG - Light Weight, Easy to Use, Stops Crashes")

We are dedicated and focused on providing servers with the best answer to prop
griefers, killers, and exploiters. We saw all the currently available addons and
felt that neither one of them alone could really do everything that we wanted it
to do, so naturally we made our own and decided to share it with you.

## This does still require a prop protection addon

### Compatible prop protection addons (with CPPI)

* [Falco's Prop Protection (FPP)](https://github.com/FPtje/Falcos-Prop-protection/)
* [PatchProtect](https://github.com/Patcher56/PatchProtect)
* [Simple Prop Protection (SPP)](https://github.com/Donkie/SimplePropProtection)

### ⚠ Don't use more then one prop protection/anti prop griefing addon at a time!

### ( You have been warned! )

* ⚠ Detours [PhysgunPickup](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/GM/PhysgunPickup) for better confirmations
* ⚠ Detours [SetColor](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Entity/SetColor) to prevent stuff from turning purple/pink unexpectedly
* ⚠ Detours [SetCollisionGroup](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Entity/SetCollisionGroup) to prevent overrides

Lag triggers are based on fancy algorithms and timers, if you are getting false positives try messing around with the values.

If you find any issue, exploit, possible improvement, suggestions, feel free to make an issue!
